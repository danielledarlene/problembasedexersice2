        <p><center>Ran Takahashi is a great Wing announcer / Outside hitter who started his career at Higashiyama High School, where it was immediately obvious that he has great talent and that he has a great future ahead of him. Coaches and others had high expectations of him and predicted a brilliant career for him and they seem to have been right.

        After leaving Higashiyama High School, the next destination in his career was Nippon Sport Science University where he arrived in 2020. At that time, he started playing for the Japanese national team, in February last year, when it was already clear to everyone that the team was given a big name for the future.

        The big clubs started to be interested in him and then came the invitation from Italy, more precisely it was Kioene Padova, a club that wanted to see the Japanese in his team as soon as possible. Takahashi is overjoyed with this transfer and is aware of what kind of club it is, and he hopes to adjust as soon as possible â€œPadova have several young players.</center></p>
